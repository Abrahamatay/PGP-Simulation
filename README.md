# PGP Simulation

This project simulates the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) protocol for secure communication. The system uses RSA for public-key encryption, AES for symmetric encryption, and SHA-256 for message hashing. 

## Features:
- RSA key generation
- AES encryption for message confidentiality
- Digital signature for message integrity
- Secure message transmission via TCP sockets

Run the sender and receiver Python scripts:
python3 sender.py
python3 receiver.py

Requirements:

    Python 3.x

    cryptography library
